* Users can list a ticket for an event (concert, sports) for sale
* Other users can purchase this ticket
* Any user can list tickets for sale and purchase tickets
* When a user attempts to purchase a ticket, the ticket is 'locked' for 15 minutes. The user has 15 minutes to enter their payment info.
* While locked, no other user can purchase the ticket. After 15 minutes, the ticket should 'unlock'
* Ticket prices can be edited if they are not locked
